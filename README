#cmdrunner

Starts a go command server which accepts commands and runs them

Abandonware alert!

I started this to use it to run commands from vim in the background.
But, have found a better way to do it now. You can check it here:

However, this code works in its current state. You can use it by:

1. Starting the ./cmdrunner
2. Sending your commands to the /tmp/cmdrunner.sock unix domain socket. You can 
   use 'socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/cmdrunner.sock' to test it.
